# Ha-Co-project
My first project with python.
Simple application for visualisation of COVID19 on the districts of haryana.
**Note :** I have removed the essential details from the file *credentials.json* which are absolutely necessary for running the application. 
This was done because the data I access from is from a governmental database which I obtained through permissions and authorizations from the concerned authority.
I have been allowed to use the data for personal uses only and not for publicizing it yet. Will make changes in the *credentials.json* file if approved by the authority.
